      The Annual Value (AV) of a property is the estimated gross annual rent that can be collected if it is rented out, excluding furniture, maintenance costs. The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) is the government body responsible for determining the AV of properties, and the actual or potential rental income that can be collected from your property is not relevant. In 2018, the median annual value of a 2, 3, 4 and 5 bedroom HDB flat is $5,100, $7,860, $9,600 and $10,380 respectively, and the median annual value of a condo (including executive condo) and landed property is $22,200 and $34,200 respectively.
